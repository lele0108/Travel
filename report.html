           <p>When we were first tasked with creating a solution for migrating traditional media outlets to modern media techniques, we decided as a team to start from scratch. We completely ignored current media practices. Today, we're connected in thousands of different ways, for example, the internet, radio, word of mouth, and much more. </p>
           <h3>Media Examples:</h3>

           </br>
           <p>Different media, coming in at different times. What's the last time you picked up a newspaper from the newspaper stand or your local coffee shop? We can't remember our last time. It's not a surprise to us that newspaper advertisement revenue has been <b>freefalling since 2000</b>, now less than <b>half of what they earned a decade ago.</b></p>
           </br>
           <p>Uh oh, that's <b>not good</b>.</p>
           </br>
           <p>We've devised of a solution to disrupt media as it is today. Rise profits while lowering operating costs. We're in the 21st centurary, let's move forward and adapt a modern media strategy. </p>

           <h2>So what?</h2>
           </br>
             <p>As you can see, traditional media distribution practices that are still used today come from as early as the 17th centurary. Wow. We've been relying on the same distribution of media for almost 5,000 years. There has to be a better way to do it now.</p>

         <p>The more important thing is, why isn't newspaper making money? People still have eyes, we still need the news, so why aren't people buying newspapers? Is it because of electronic devices? Facebook? Twitter? North Korea?</p>
         <p>Unfortunately, the answer isn't that simple. While newspapers revenue have declined more than 50% the past decade, radio revenue is going up. Thinking about it, radio is almost as old as modern newspaper. So why isn't radio dying?</p>
         </br>
         <p><b>Nothing has replaced radio yet.</b></p>
         <p>Newspapers are being replaced by digital media and social network interaction. In a study conducted in 2008, where Pew Research Center surveyed 1,500 adults asking them how they get most of their national and international news, 35% of adults answered newspaper, while a whopping <b>40% of adults</b> answered digital media and the internet.</p>

         <p><b>Not only is newspaper in trouble, TV is starting a rapid decline.</b></p>
         </br>
         <p>What's worse? In a estimation produced in 2005, while <b>70% of older Americans read newspapers daily</b>, only <b>20% of the younger generation did</b>. In addition, production of newspaper cost almost <b>50% more than digital publishing</b> (The Columbia Journalism Review, 2007).</p>

         <div class="span11">
         <p><b>Alright, newspaper isn't making money. What do we do?</b></p>
         </br>
         <p>Our first solution would be a digital media presence. In 2012, <b>one in two Americans read news online</b>, a massive increase from 2011. Online publishing also costs <b>50% less</b>, because you eliminate costs of printing, delivery, and much more. Did we tell you that digital publishing also saves trees? By not publishing a printed Sunday newspaper, you can <b>save 500,000 trees</b>. That's a lot.</p>
         </br>
         <p><b>That's pretty slick. We're a traditional newspaper company, and we want to move digital. How do we do this? </b></p>
         </br>
         <p>It's actually as hard as it looks. Although the internet can be a dark cave for beginners, it's rewards are just as sweet once you get it working. Here are our steps to getting started:</p>
         </br>
         <ol>
         <li>Hire a webmaster and contract with a web design studio. Your digital presence is important, so you want to hire the right people. Your website, design, logo, search engine optimization, and page speed will define your digital success. </li>
         <li>Train your team for digital media publishing. Take a day of work, and have workshops for the whole company. Show your editors how the digital tools work, and how publishing will be different.</li>
         <li>Spread the word about your site. Dedicate the front page of your newspaper to announcing your new site. Don't be shy, people love digital media. </li>
         <li>Monotize your site. Google adwords, BuySellAds, and other advertising networks are great places to start</li>
         <li>Control engagement via comments, and spread the word through social media. Grow your site.</li>
         </ol>
         </br>
         <p><b>Great, it doesn't seem that hard. But will digital media actually make money?</b></p>
         </br>
         <p>It will. In a study done in 2012, while printing lost $798 million of advertisement revenue, digital media gained $32 million of revenue. That's a lot of money, considering that your costs are 50% lower than print.</p>
